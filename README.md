### Final Project
Final project for the Inteligent data processing subject. It consist on the analysis of a dataset of our choise, we decided to take the [UCI ML Drug Review dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/kuc-hackathon-winter-2018). Some techniques used are listed below: 

- Data mining
- Classification of the illness using the review of the drug used
- Logistic, linear and polynomial regresion
- Clustering

The code was writen using Rmd and can be found [here](./src/memoria.Rmd)

### Theorical work

Other part of the subject consisted on analyze some algorithm or technique used in the field, so we decided to work on the Monte-Carlo algorithm. The document can be found [here](./Theory/Monte-Carlo.pdf)
